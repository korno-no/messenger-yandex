# Yandex Practicum MESSENGER

<font size="5">ðŸŒŸ About the Project </font>

This project is part of the Yandex Practicum Middle Front-End course. The goal is to build a functional and user-friendly messenger application using modern web technologies.

The project utilizes tools such as Vite, Handlebars, and other key technologies to create a scalable and interactive web application. Instead of relying on third-party libraries, weâ€™ve implemented custom solutions for:

- **Routing**: A custom routing solution for handling client-side navigation.
- **Flux**: A custom state management pattern inspired by Flux, built from scratch to manage application state.
- **HTTP Requests**: A custom HTTP layer to handle API requests, ensuring full control over the interaction with the server.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication between users for messaging, implemented from scratch for seamless interaction.
